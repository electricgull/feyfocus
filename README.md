# FeyFocus

FeyFocus is a project I developed for a class, allowing me to learn Swift. This application tracks the duration that an application and its files remain open and in focus. For instance, if an architecture firm needs to monitor the time spent on customer project files, users can open FeyFocus, select the architecture design software, and the app will track the time each project file is actively used.
